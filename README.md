## Instructions

### Getting Started:

Clone this repository so that the code is available on your local machine:

> **Note:** Run this command from the directory where you want to store your code (ex. `lessons/`)

    git clone git@github.com:Code-the-Dream-School/web-basics-2-week-1-[your-username].git

Navigate to the directory you just cloned in your terminal:

    cd web-basics-2-week-1-[your-username]

Create a new local branch to work on separate from the mainline branch (`master`):

    git checkout -b assignment

Make sure that you have `node.js` installed on your machine so that you can run JavaScript in the terminal:

    node -v

If the output says `command not found`, then [download node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download) and try the command again.

Finally, open the project directory in your code editor and continue to the next section.

### Task List:

For this assignment, all changes will be made within the `index.js` file.

- [ ] Step 1: Complete each of the challenges outlined in the file comments
- [ ] Step 2: Execute the JavaScript you wrote by opening the terminal and running `node index.js`
- [ ] Step 3: Validate the output of all your challenge answers

### Final Step:

Check the status of your local repository to double-check the changes you made:

    git status

Stage the JavaScript file that you edited:

    git add index.js

Create a commit for the changes you made and add a message:

    git commit -m "your message"

Push your branch to the remote repository (visible in GitHub):

    git push origin assignment

Create a Pull Request in GitHub and request feedback:

1. Navigate to the "Pull Requests" tab in your repository
2. Click the "New pull request" button
3. Set the base branch to `master` and the compare branch to `assignment`
4. Click the "Create pull request" button
5. Ask a mentor for feedback in Slack or add them as a reviewer

Click the button to "Merge" your Pull Request and celebrate ðŸŽ‰
